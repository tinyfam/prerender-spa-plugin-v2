# prerender-spa-plugin-v2
https://github.com/chrisvfritz/prerender-spa-plugin  The original project, prerender-spa-plugin, has been unmaintained for a long time and required significant time to adapt. As a result, a new version was created to support the latest architecture, making it ready to use out of the box.
