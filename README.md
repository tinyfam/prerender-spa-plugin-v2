## Overview
The original prerender-spa-plugin has long been unmaintained and required substantial effort to adapt to newer architectures. This new version has been created to provide out-of-the-box support for the latest frameworks and build tools, including Vue 3 and Webpack, ensuring a seamless experience for developers who need pre-rendering capabilities for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

This version is designed to be easy to integrate and configure, so you can focus on building your application without worrying about complex setup or compatibility issues.
